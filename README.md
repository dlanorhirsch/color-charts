# colors_project
Exploratory project for development purposes

This project started with practicing JS code in the DOM and applying it to a project involving color. (This may not be the end result of the "color project"). Applied JS to create elements, text nodes, event handlers, etc., and will be adding other JS elements as well. The HTML file contains some structure. The focus was on using JS for specific elements of the page, but not all. Lastly, CSS was applied for styling, speficially CSS Grid. This was a particular challenge because it required reviewing CSS Grid code (alignment, justification, grid templates etc., etc., to both JS created DOM elements and HTML elements and integrating them into a cohesive web-page. The development of this page in ongoing.
